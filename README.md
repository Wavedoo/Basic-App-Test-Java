# Basic-App-Test-Java

Using Java and xml I made a basic app used to calculate how much a grade is worth overall based on its weight. <br>
I originally made a [Kotlin version](https://github.com/Wavedoo/Basic-App-Test-Kotlin) to get a basic understanding of xml

## The process
The app took about half an hour to make due to the fact that I reused xml from the [Kotlin version](https://github.com/Wavedoo/Basic-App-Test-Kotlin) <br>
Redoing the Kotlin part in Java was simple since it used the same concepts but using Java. <br>
