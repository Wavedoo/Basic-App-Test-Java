# Basic-App-Test-Java

This is a repo I've been using as testing grounds for android development consisting of small actitivites. Throughout this I have learned android development skills such as: <br> 
-How to use xml to create a layout for an activity<br>
-Creating styles to reuse in xml files<br>
-How to get views in Java that can be used to retrieve user input and display outputs<br>
-Navigating throughout an app's activities using intents<br>
-How to save strings to an xml file and use it in the app

### Activitites
[Main activity](https://github.com/Wavedoo/Basic-App-Test-Java/blob/master/README.md#main-activityy)<br>
[Grade calculator](https://github.com/Wavedoo/Basic-App-Test-Java/blob/master/README.md#grade-calculator)<br>
[Oops](https://github.com/Wavedoo/Basic-App-Test-Java/blob/master/README.md#oops-activity)

## Main Activity
This is the main activity where you can navigate to the other activities within the app.<br>
<br>
Learning outcome:<br>
-How to navigate to a new screen using intents

## Grade Calculator
The original activity was just this, and the original Readme is shown here. <br>
Using Java and xml I made a basic app used to calculate how much a grade is worth overall based on its weight.

### The process
The app took about half an hour to make due to the fact that I reused xml from the [Kotlin version](https://github.com/Wavedoo/Basic-App-Test-Kotlin) <br>
Redoing the Kotlin part in Java was simple since it used the same concepts but using Java. <br>

## Oops Activity
An activity that was originally meant to be a calculator, but I ended up being too lazy to complete it ans just left it as a mismash of various little things<br>
Learning outcomes:<br>
-Using styles to reuse in xml<br>
-Using a ScrollView instead of a more restrictive layout<br>
<br>
Issue to overcome:<br>
-How to make an image display properly on screen
