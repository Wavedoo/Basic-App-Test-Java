# Basic-App-Test-Java

So I've been using this as testing grounds for android dev, and I <i>should</i> update the readme, but I am hungry and want to eat. Maybe later if I remember or have time.

# Old Readme
Using Java and xml I made a basic app used to calculate how much a grade is worth overall based on its weight.

## The process
The app took about half an hour to make due to the fact that I reused xml from the [Kotlin version](https://github.com/Wavedoo/Basic-App-Test-Kotlin) <br>
Redoing the Kotlin part in Java was simple since it used the same concepts but using Java. <br>
